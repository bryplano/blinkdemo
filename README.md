## Using this demo

**Note**: No API key or functionality has been written as part of this demo. This is only for attempting to build an Ionic 4 app with the BlinkId plugin from Cordova.

1. **Required**: Install wget on your machine, preferably via HomeBrew ([see here for Mac instructions](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-wget-mac/)).
2. Download this sample application repo and unzip the project
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `ionic cordova build <ios / android>` to build the app for iOS or Android (ex: `ionic cordova build ios` for an iOS build)
